<p> Durham House of Pets is one of the oldest operating pet stores in the country. Our founder John Smith sold pieces of rope to Native Americans to lease the first wolf pups they were trying to domesticate. From there the pet store grew with the United States into the industrial revolution. The pet store took off during this time. With the invention of the assembly line the pet store could produce mass numbers of rubber balls that were given to dogs to play fetch. As iron became cheaper the pet store could go into the bird cage business. this allowed the company to expanded to include bird lovers. Our company weathered the first and second world wars by making bird cages out of plastic when iron became increasingly expensive. The long history brings us to today. We are a small company with values tied to this wonderful city and want to watch it grow and change as we have. So, have a look around and see what this store can offer you and your pets. Enjoy!</p>

<p>We Care, when you come into one of our stores you are not another customer, you are not a sale you are; Scooby and Shaggy looking for dog treats, you are Haji and Bandit on an adventure to find the best dog food, or you are Jon Arbuckle taking Garfield and Odie to find the newest pet toys. When you come into our center you are just as iconic.   </p>
<p> We are knowledgeable, our staff is highly trained and will listen to all your needs and try to find the best fit for you, for the lowest possible price. Our employees wonâ€™t push sales or product, but instead try to strive for every customer to leave our center satisfied. </p>
<p> Lastly, we are in your community, we make sure that our dollars stay local. Our community is the reason that we do so well in business so we try and give back. We pay our employees to donate one of their shifts to volunteer at a community dog shelter once a week. Animals want to find homes and this is one of the best ways to help suffering animals find happiness.    </p>
